_"So what does <company_name>'s stack look like?" - me at Cal career fair_

People—past me included—really like asking this question. While it is cool to talk about technologies other people use, it is also a sure pathway to flamewars.
If you are nice, the follow up question would be "How was your experience using X?" but if you do not appreciate life and hate baby yoda you will say
**"WHY NOT USE Y? DO YOU NOT LOVE YOUR MOTHER. Y IS THE BEST"**. I really hope y'all appreciate life and love baby yoda.

We are a two person shop; me and my brother. Our backend is using Flask and our frontend is React. We use Postgres and we have a thin layer of Redis for pub sub (donation alert).
Code is hosted on GitLab complete with the CI/CD. That's pretty much it.

## Frontend

We use react-static to export everything into a static HTML. For styling we used tachyon but we are moving to Chakra-UI. While tachyons fucks, Chakra-UI plays
much better with React. It is hosted on Netlify.

## Backend

I can hear people say, **"WHY PYTHON??"**. No particular reason other than my brother and I are better at it than any other programming language. Our python layer is very thin;
it validates input and asks Postgres for answer. Almost all of the complex business logic is done in Postgres. It is deployed on Digital Ocean $10 droplet which 
never breaks 10% of CPU utilization. I previously debated on downgrading it to $5 but I also like to sleep at night so it stays \$10 for now.

## Deployment

We use a simple docker-compose that provision our flask, Redis, and traefik reverse proxy in that same machine.

## Future Plans

In frontend department we are moving to Now and Next.js. While react-static gives us static page, Next.js will allow us to
be both a server-rendered-app and static app in a same codebase. It fuccs harder.

For backend, we are shying away from Redis. I am trying to practice minimalism here; the less stuff we work with the better. I am trying to implement the PubSub part using
Postgres and Postgres only.

See? Nothing really fancy-it just works for us. Please do not DDoS my pretty little thing. Ping me at [@tibudiyanto](https://twitter.com/tibudiyanto) if you want to say hi
or if you think there are some stuff that should be added here. ✌️
